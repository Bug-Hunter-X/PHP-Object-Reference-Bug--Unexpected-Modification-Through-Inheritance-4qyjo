In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error is the improper handling of object references, especially when dealing with inheritance and cloning.  Consider this example:

```php
class ParentClass {
    public $value = 10;
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public $childValue = 20;
}

$parent = new ParentClass();
$child = new ChildClass();

$parent = $child; // Assign the child object to the parent object

$parent->value = 30;

var_dump($child->value); // Outputs 30, unexpectedly modifying the child object
```

The issue lies in assigning the child object to the parent object.  This doesn't create a copy; it just creates another reference to the same object in memory. Changes made via the `$parent` reference are reflected in the `$child` reference, leading to unexpected behavior and potential bugs.
